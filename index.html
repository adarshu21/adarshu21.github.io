                <li><strong>Scalability and Its Types:</strong> The final part of our discussion focused on scalability, a crucial aspect of system design. I explained the two primary types of scalability: horizontal and vertical scaling. Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves adding more machines or nodes to a system, which allows for the distribution of load across multiple servers. This approach is often used in distributed systems and cloud environments where elasticity is required to handle varying workloads. Vertical scaling, or scaling up, involves increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more resources such as CPU, memory, or storage. I discussed the benefits and limitations of each approach, emphasizing that the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as cost, complexity, and performance needs. I also explained how these scalability strategies can be implemented in cloud environments, using auto-scaling groups and load balancers to dynamically adjust resources based on demand. The interviewer seemed pleased with my thorough understanding of scalability and ended the round on a positive note. Although he did not provide specific feedback, his supportive demeanor indicated that he was satisfied with my answers.</li>
                <li><strong>DRDO Project - Target Recognition and Semantic Segmentation:</strong> I also discussed my internship project at LRDE, DRDO, where I worked on target recognition and semantic segmentation for SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images of military vehicles. This project involved developing and training deep learning models tailored to the unique challenges of Indian terrain. I utilized advanced models like Roboflow-SegFormer and U-Net (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in segmenting and identifying targets within Umbra-SAR images. I explained how I approached the task by first pre-processing the SAR images to enhance feature extraction and then iteratively refining the model to improve its performance on complex terrain features. The interviewer was particularly interested in how these models could be applied to real-world defense scenarios, and I detailed how the techniques I developed could contribute to more accurate and reliable target recognition in various environmental conditions.</li>
